# UX

My UX process was mainly focused on achiving an easy to read targeted information from my personal journey and why the change of direction to coding and software development enables me to utilise all my life experiences and skills into software developemt.
The main audience for my project is to prospects employers intrested to understand who am I, my background and what challenges drives me forward.
At the initial stage of my UX design I got familiar with Balsamic wireframe, which allowed me to sketch a visual picture of which design will be more effective on achiving my desire result to the user.
