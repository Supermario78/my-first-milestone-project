# My First Milestone Project - Personal Website

**Version 1.0.0**

CVs by tradition offer a limited 2 dimensional source of information about a candidate. My goal with this project is to allow prospect employers to get a deeper understanding of myself as a professional and allow me to showcase my new skills as a software developer.

## UX

My UX process was mainly focused on achieving relevant information from my personal journey and why I chose to change my direction to coding and software development. The main audience for my project is to prospect employers interested in understanding who I am, my background and what challenges drives me forward.
At the initial stage of my UX design I got familiar with Balsamic wireframe, which allowed me to sketch a visual picture of which design will be more effective on achieving my desired result to the user.
