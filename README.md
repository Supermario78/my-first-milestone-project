# My First Milestone Project - Personal Website

**Version 1.0.0**

CVs by tradition offer a limited 2 dimensional source of information about a candidate. My goal with this project is to allow prospect employers to get a deeper understanding of myself as a professional and allow me to showcase my new skills as a software developer.

## UX

My UX process was mainly focused on achieving relevant information from my personal journey and why I chose to change my direction to coding and software development. The main audience for my project is to prospect employers interested in understanding who I am, my background and what challenges drives me forward.
At the initial stage of my UX design I got familiar with Balsamic wireframe, which allowed me to sketch a visual picture of which design will be more effective on achieving my desired result to the user.

### User Feedback

-As a recruiter and first time visitor to Mario's web page, I found his landing page easy to read, user friendly and with intuitive navigation, the video feature gave me an instant feel for Mario's personality and career focus.
The recommendations feature, also provided me with a quick reference of how he was perceived by others who worked with him or above him, I particularly like the pop up option to contact him directly without leaving the site.
Overall, it is a great effort but with room for improvement.
 
-As a visitor, looking for someone to colaborate with, I liked how sections such as the recommendations, work history and skills where clear and simple to view and understand,it was like a 3D C.V.

## Testing

I have gone a great lenght to make sure testing was done to the best of my abiliy. 

### Code Checking

I have checked and worked on all the necesary corrections to make sure all my pages where CCS3 And HTML5 aprooved, I had 9 errors on HTML5 and 12 on CSS3 of which I managed to fix.

### WEb Broswers

I have run my project on both Firefox and Google Chrome and found no issues on desktop mode.

On Google Chrome mobile view, I did found some issues on the header dropdown toggle menu option feature, for all 3 of my links pages, I managed to fix the contact-form page on mobile view and work-history page, but the dropdown toggle menu bar on the index page needs further improovement as you can see from the picture below.
